My proposed algorithm will involve the use of recursion.
Each of the Node of the left part of the tree is transversed, looking for a child node, each of the child node is also transversed
to look for inner node, once the recuursion is completed on that node, the parent loop moves on to the next node.
But of course, the order of transversing the node would be in-order i.e from left to the root to the right.
