Javascript Programming Test

Each solution to each question is a different folder identified with the question number.
Questions 2 - 5 contains a 'run' file in addition to the JS file (which contains the implementation) to show how the functions are called from the html file.
Question 6 has other files from the boiler template that was used for the scaffolding.
Implementation of Question 6 is however incomplete. It doesn't contain the Karma test case.
